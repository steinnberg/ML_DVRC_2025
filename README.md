## 🌟 Welcome to the Journey

This course will take you from **fundamentals of supervised learning** to **advanced ensemble methods**, ending with a **hands-on final project**.

It is designed as a **progressive and practical path**: each session builds upon the previous one, with coding labs, visualization exercises, and critical thinking challenges.  
Expect to **code, visualize, evaluate, and explain** — that’s the DVRC spirit.

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

>[!TIP]
>Machine Learning is not just about fitting models — it’s about understanding the data, evaluating critically, and communicating clearly.

* **This course emphasizes:**

- 🧩 Conceptual clarity before coding
- ⚗️ Experimentation through live notebooks
- 📈 Visualization and interpretation
- 🤝 Collaboration during the final project
- 🚀 Expected Outcomes
